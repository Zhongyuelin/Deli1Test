# Deli1Test - UMASS Fall 2024 DACSS690R Week 2 Example

## Project Overview
This repository is created as part of the **UMASS Fall 2024 DACSS690R** course for **Week 2**. The project demonstrates how to manage a GitHub repository, scrape data from external sources, and synchronize changes between a local machine and the cloud (GitHub).

The project includes two data files:
- **Population data** from the CIA World Factbook
- **International Innovation Index** data from Wikipedia

## Directory Structure
```
├── dataFiles                        # Folder containing the downloaded and scraped data files
│   ├── cia_population_data.csv       # Population data downloaded from the CIA World Factbook
│   └── international_innovation_index.csv  # International Innovation Index data scraped from Wikipedia
├── README.md                         # Project documentation
```

## Data Files
- **cia_population_data.csv**: Contains country population data sourced from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/guide-to-country-comparisons/).
- **international_innovation_index.csv**: This file contains a table scraped from [Wikipedia's International Innovation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Innovation_Index), showing rankings and innovation scores for different countries.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
To download the repository to your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorganization/Deli1Test.git
```

### 2. Make changes, then commit and push:
After making any changes to the files, use these commands to commit the changes and push them to GitHub:

```bash
git commit -am "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Synchronize with the cloud (GitHub):
If changes were made directly in GitHub (e.g., editing the `README` file), pull the latest version to synchronize your local repository:

```bash
git pull
```

### Explanation of Markdown Formatting:

- **`#` and `##`**: Used for heading levels. `#` creates an H1 (main title), while `##` creates an H2 (subheading).
- **Code blocks**: Indicated by three backticks (```) before and after code sections. This is used to format shell commands or code snippets.
- **Directory structure**: Presented using the `tree`-like format to visualize folder hierarchy.
- **Links**: Markdown supports hyperlinks using `[link text](URL)` syntax, which I have used to link to external data sources.

This version of the `README` has a clearer structure and explains the content concisely while adhering to the Markdown format.
